# Emotion Recognition Baseline Model

## Overview
This repository contains code for a baseline emotion detection model developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is designed to detect facial expressions and classify them into predefined emotion categories. It serves as a starting point for research comparisons in the field of facial expression recognition tasks.

## Features
- Implements a CNN-based architecture for facial expression recognition.
- Detects and classifies facial expressions into predefined emotion categories.
- Provides a starting point for research comparisons and experimentation.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Facial-Expression-CNN-Baseline.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

4. Evaluate the model:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```
